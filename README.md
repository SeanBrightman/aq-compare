# Code Challenge Assignement

## Question 1:
https://github.com/SeanBrightman/aq-compare/tree/master/src


## Question 2:

I would add  another boolean variable named partTimeFlag and a method named isPartTime() that checks whether or not the employee is working full time.
There could also be something within the method that defaults the partTimeFlag to false if the managerFlag boolean returns true, assuming that all managers are full time by default.
